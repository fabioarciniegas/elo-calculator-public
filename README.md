# Elo rating Calculator for Droid

A free and open source android Elo Calculator, supports single match and tournament mode. 
Useful particularly in tournaments when you would like to predict your final rating before the results are posted officially in uscf site.

This project is exactly as the app in the playstore https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.madebydragons.elocalculator except the icons which are licensed only for the app and are replaced here by empty 1x1 pngs.

Enjoy,
